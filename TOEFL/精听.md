- Hi, I'm Robert West, we had an appointment. 

- You're here about your graduation form right? I'm about to print that.

- OK, thanks, I'm kind of wondering what it is about, I mean I've completed more than enough course work `to` graduate.

  > - ​	Oh good => 听成 OK.
  > - I mean I completely more enough courses to graduate. 
  > - more than enough course work to graduate. 这里的to也是Schwa Sound.

- ~~Oh~~ All this is strictly routine, of course you have **to** finish your courses work, but this ~~forming~~ form is just for the  administrative check-list.

  > - strick => strictly 
  >
  > - have to: 我未能听得出这里的to是**Schwa Sound** 【ˈhæv tə】 注意这里的 【ə】读的**又轻又快**！
  >
  > - of course you have **to** finished
  > - but this form  is 因为连读我听成了 forming 
  > - administrative, 由于a读的很轻，我一开始一直听成了mini???以为是什么最小化检查

- It's      last fee, that all the thing.

- Hi, I'm Rober West, we have an appointment

- You here about your graduation form, right? I'm about to print that.

- Oh good, thanks, I'm kind of wandering what it's of about.I'm mean I've compeleted more enough work courses to graduate. 

- Oh this is a strickly routine. Of course you have **to** finished your course work, but forme is a just administrative check list.

- It's ~~all~~ our way **of** making sure you dont' have any unfinished unversity business, like ~~a~~ unpaid tuition  bill or labfish?? that's sort of thing. 

  > - **lab fee**: 这是我第一次见到这个单词，反复听了几次未能听写出来。。。
  > - It's all way => **it's our way**: 也是第一次遇到这种表达法，需要记下来
  > - like a =>其实这里的**a**是属于口语常见的赘词，应该移除
  > - that's sort ofthing. 一开始其实听成了： that's all the thing, 也是未见过这种表达

- Well, I do have an outstanding student loan. But I was told I don't have to start paying off it until have a job.  I do have a job terview tomorrow.

  > I don't have to start paything **that** off **yet**, **not** until I get a job.

- Well, good luck with it, but no, you loan is not the issue here.

  > - your loan
  > - **it's not an** issue here.

- emm,Let's see, the only problem I see is , ~~let this~~ what's find for...ah an **over due** CD that you borrowed from the **music** library?

  > - let's this find for=> **what's this find for**：和汉语一样，有时候英语也会发出和另一个单词极其相似的音，这时候需要有能根据上下文推断出其正确的单词的能力。
  > - **overdue**: 我写成了over due,是根据句子的读音写出来的，一开始还未能理解单词的意思。
  > - borrow在口语里面确实没有**ed**， 但是根据上下文推断这里加ed可能会更好，虽然原文也没有加ed.

- Really? I~~ve~~ checked it out like three months ago, but itsn't really for me. 

  > - itsn't 是个错别字，我本意是想打 isn't
  > - isn't => wasn't 

- oh, you checked it out for ~~your~~ a friend.

- No, for a faculty member, actually. 

-
